Some people requested a Brackets Version of the Relaxed Theme. 

## Help wanted

I could need some help because I’m not willing to spent my rare free time in a theme I won’t use. 
But I would love to see that happen, and are willing to give support.

In case someone wants to work on this I will happily invite them to the Relaxed-Theme GitHub organization. Just ping me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkuehnel), [email](mailto:mail@michael-kuehnel.de) or open an Issue/PR.
